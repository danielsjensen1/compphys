Variational Method
==================

The variational method is used extensively in computational physics and deserves
a very thorough mathematical description with several examples.  We will also
show how the variational method is used in some simple quantum problems with 
known analytical solutions and how it is used in most electronic structure 
programs.

The variational method in physics
---------------------------------

Most physics students are first introduced to the variational method during 
their first class in classical mechanics through the mysterious `Lagrangian`.
