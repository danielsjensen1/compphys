Infinite Square Well
====================

The one-dimensional infinite square well problem is found in every quantum
mechanics book that I've ever read.  Here we will solve it using the variational
method and show how it compares to the exact solution. It helps illustrate some
very important issues that arise from using the variational method.

The 'exact' solution is only exact up to an overall phase, hence the
difference in sign apparent in several of the eigenfunctions.  Notice that the
highest-order wave functions are the worst approximations while the lowest-order
wave functions are the best approximations.  Notice that there was no need to 
normalize our basis functions since the overlap matrix took care of that for us.

Also explain that the approximate basis functions have to satisfy the boundary
conditions.
